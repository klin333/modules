## Test environments

* ubuntu (on travis-ci)
* win-builder
* local ubuntu 22.04, R 4.3.0

## R CMD check results

* There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs

I have resolved the following note on https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_modules.html:

Check: LazyData
Result: NOTE
     'LazyData' is specified without a 'data' directory 

## Downstream dependencies

* To the best of my knowledge there are no problems.
